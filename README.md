Monologue is a **dynamic, flexible, open-source dialogue editor** for creating branching, non-linear conversations in games. It provides a **graph-based nterface** that makes it easy to visually craft modular dialogue flows. The editor is “engine agnostic”, which means you can prototype and export your story (in JSON) for use in any game engine or framework (as long as an interpreter is written for that engine or you write it).

## Features

* **User-friendly UI:** Intuitive, modern node-graph interface for writing dialogue.
* **Flexible storytelling:** Design dynamic, branching storylines and non-linear narratives.
* **Integrated content:** Manage dialogue text along with characters, backgrounds, audio, etc. all in one place.
* **Node-based workflow:** Each step of your conversation is a *node* with custom properties and tasks.
* **Manage voicelines, music and languages:** Integrate voicelines, translations and music directly into the editor.
* **In-editor testing:** Play and debug your dialogue right inside Monologue (start from any node).
* **Open & Cross-platform:** Fully MIT-licensed open source. Standalone builds are available for Windows and Linux.

## Getting Started

1. **Download:** Get the latest version from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/monologue-tool/monologue/releases) page or [itch.io](https://atomic-junky.itch.io/monologue). (Windows and Linux executables are provided; for example, itch.io currently offers Monologue v3.0.0-dev1 for 64-bit Windows and Linux.)
2. **Run Monologue:** Launch the downloaded executable (no installation needed). Alternatively, clone the repo and open it in Godot Engine (v4.x recommended).
3. **Create/Open a Story:** In Monologue’s UI, create a new dialogue file (`*.json`) or open an existing one. A blank node canvas appears.
4. **Add Dialogue Nodes:** Click **Add Node** to create conversation nodes. Double-click a node to edit its text, speaker name, variables, conditions, or actions.
5. **Connect Nodes:** Drag connectors between nodes to build your conversation branches and choices.
6. **Play and Test:** Use the **Run ▶️** button to play through the story from any selected node. This lets you immediately test how the dialogue flows.
7. **Save/Export:** Save your project. Monologue stores dialogue data as JSON that you can integrate into your game or engine.

## Use Cases

Monologue can be used anywhere you need structured dialogues or narrative flowcharts. Common examples include:

* **Visual Novels:** Craft branching storylines and character conversations for a visual novel.
* **RPG/Adventure Dialogues:** Design NPC dialog trees, quest conversations, and interactive story events.
* **Interactive Fiction:** Prototype text adventures, or story-driven dialogue sequences.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly sketch out narrative flows or script conversations before implementing them in-game.
